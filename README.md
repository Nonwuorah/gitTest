At this checkpoint, you are asked to write an algorithm that reads a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:


Follow These Steps
The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
The number of vowels in the sentence.
You have to keep in mind that: 

Each character will be treated separately.
The last character is the point.
Use three variables as counters.

How We'll Evaluate
Your checkpoint will be evaluated based on these criteria, each rated from 0 to 5.
