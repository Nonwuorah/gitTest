Variables and Initialization
- char: the input character
- sentence_length: the length of the sentence (initialized to 0)
- word_count: the number of words in the sentence (initialized to 0)
- vowel_count: the number of vowels in the sentence (initialized to 0)

Algorithm
1. Read the first character from the sentence into char.
2. While char is not the point (.):

    - Increment sentence_length.
    - If char is a space, increment word_count.
    - If char is a vowel (A, E, I, O, U, a, e, i, o, u), increment vowel_count.
    - Read the next character from the sentence into char.
3. Increment sentence_length (to count the point at the end).
4. If the sentence is not empty (i.e., sentence_length > 1), increment word_count (to count the last word).
5. Output the values of sentence_length, word_count, and vowel_count.

Example Use Case
Input: "Hello World."

Output:

- Sentence length: 13
- Word count: 2
- Vowel count: 3
